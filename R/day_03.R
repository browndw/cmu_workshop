# Note that ggplot gives us a warning about choosing 'binwidth'.
# This is the option for telling ggplot the size the buckets to group our values into.
# One common way to determine binwidth is with the Freedmanâ€“Diaconis rule:
# a rule based on the interquartile range, which we can calculate using IQR()
# and the number of observations, which we can calculate using length()

# Now let's try let's return to the hedges and boosters data we generated
# in the previous workshop.
# First, we can read in the counts.
micusp_hb <- read_csv("data/tables/micusp_hb.csv")

# It would be useful to attach these statistics to our

# across different categories. We'll use left_join() to connect them by the
# shared "text_id" column

hb_joined <- micusp_hb %>%

hb_joined

# gather() does a bit of table rearranging that will let us compare
# hedges/boosters as different groups of the same kind of measure. Don't worry
# about understanding that quite yet - but do take a look at how it changes
# the table!
hb_ratios <- hb_joined %>% 
  gather(token_class, norm_freq, hedges_norm:boosters_norm)

# Now all our normalized values are in the column "norm_freq" and the CATEGORY
# of that frequency (either "hedges_norm" or "boosters_norm") is in the
# "token_class" column

# To compare the "spread" of a numeric variable, a boxplot can be very useful to
# show distributions.

# Try varying the x axis to compare student gender or discipline category

### YOUR CODE HERE

# We're using the x and fill aesthetics to divide our data along 2 categories -
# you could add a third division by using facet_wrap() as well

ggplot(hb_ratios, aes(x = discipline_cat, y = norm_freq, fill = token_class)) +

# This looks heinous. Flip the coordinates, and try to reorder() the x axis to
# order disciplines by the frequency of these tokens

# Now let's try plotting some time-series data.

# Next, we can combine our counts into a single data frame.
# To do this, we use bind_rows(), which stacks data frames top to bottom,

# Also, we'll use .id to add a column that idenfies where the data originated --
# creating a grouping variable that we can use in our aesthetics.

# The data looks quite messy in the early nineteenth century --

# To truncate our plot, we can subset it using subset().
# For example, if we want the plot to bein with the twentieth century we can
# specify that the year column must be greater than 1899.

# which is not usually good practice.
